Please follow these guidelines when making a PR:

* Double-check that a quote or one like it is not already included.
* Fortunes should be separated by `%` signs.
* Please enclose fortune quotations in straight quotes (`"`).
* Signatures go on the very next line with a tab and two hyphens (`--`).
* After adding the quotes, run `strfile programming-fortunes` to re-generate the `dat` index.
	* Or, if you have Node installed, `npm i` or `yarn` to register a git hook which does this automatically before every commit.
* Keep quotes safe for work!
